This example illustrates the use of the FAS Multigrid solver with an externally specified NL function in Chombo -- for solving nonlinear problems. 
It is based on the execAMRFAS example which was written for the poisson equation.

For more details of the problem solved, see AMRFAS_extNL.pdf

To build the example:
make all DIM=<1,2,3> DEBUG=<TRUE,FALSE> OPT=<TRUE,FALSE,HIGH> MPI=<TRUE,FALSE>

To run the example:
FASSolve<config>.ex inputs

if compiled with HDF5, FASOut.<DIM>d.hdf5 will be written containing the RHS and the solution.
