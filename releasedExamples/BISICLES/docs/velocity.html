<h1>BISICLES ice velocity</h1>

<p>
  The ice velocity  calculation depends at minimum on the <a href='geometry.html'>ice sheet geometry</a> and 
  <a href='stress.html'>the in-ice and basal stresses</a>. It may also depend on 
  the <a href='thermodynamics.html'>thermodynamics</a> and other factors that influence the in-ice and basal stresses.
</p>

<p>
  If you have built the doxygen code documentation, the C++ class hierarchy underlying
  the ice velocity calculation is described at
  <a href='../code/doc/doxygen/html/classIceVelocitySolver.html'>classIceVelocitySolver.html</a>
</p>

<p>
  An ice velocity model is specified at run time by setting
</p>
<pre>
  amr.velocity_solver_type = &lt integer solver_type, default 1 &gt
</pre>
<p>
  Additional options include
</p>
<pre>
  amr.velocity_solver_interval = &lt integer n, default 1 &gt recompute the velocity every n timesteps.
  amr.regrid_interval = &lt integer m, default 1 &gt recompute the mesh and velocity every m timesteps.
</pre>

<p>
Options for  &lt solver_type &gt are

  <h2><a name='jfnk'>JFNK Solver </a></h2>
<p>
  BISICLES JFNK (Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov) solver
  solves the nonlinear vertically integrated (SSA, L1L2) stress equations
  using a matrix-free Newton method. It is the default for conventional (forward)
  simulations, and is also used by the <a href='#inversevi'>Inverse Vertically Integrated Velocity Solver</a>.
  BISICLES spends around 95% of its time solving the stress equations, and it is also
  the calculation most likely to fail. That said, it often fails or perform poorly
  when the input conditions - basal traction, ice thickness, boundary conditions - are
  incorrect in some way. For example, a region of floating ice unconnected to either grounded
  ice, a rocky wall, or a domain boundary with Dirichlet conditions does not have
  a unique solution - it is an ill-posed problem. So if you have problems - especially on
  time step 0 - check the input data first, especially the <a href='geometry.html'>geometry</a>
  and the <a href='stress.html#basal'>basal traction</a>.
</p>
<p>
  However, problems that are in theory well-posed but ill-conditioned -
  for example the Drygalski ice tongue - can see their iterations
  diverge, and in those cases paying attention to the JFNKSolver options can be useful.
  The most useful course in such cases is to try the <a href='#jfnk-petsc'>PETSc linear solvers </a>
</p>
</p>
<h3><a name='jfnk-petsc'> Option: PETSc linear solvers </a></h3> 
By default, the JFNK solver uses the  Chombo geometric multigrid (GMG)
linear solvers to compute the Newton step.
If you find that convergence of the velocity solver is stalling (or even diverging), you might want
to try a PETSc algebraic multigrid (AMG) solver. To switch to the PETSc solvers,
<ol>
  <li>
    You will need a .petsrc file to tell the PETSc solvers what to do. PETSc has an enormous range
    of options, but the important thing is to use a suitable preconditioner because the PETSc default
    does not work well in many cases. We usually find
    the <a href='http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/linear_solvers/sls_hypre.html'>HYPRE </a> BoomerAMG solver. 
    to work well. A minimal .petscrc file would be something like
    <pre>
#.petsrc
#use the hypre / boomeramg preconditioner
-pc_type hypre
-pc_hypre_type boomeramg
#gmres is the safe (and default) option for a KSP method. bcgs is sometimes quicker
-ksp_type gmres
#this makes the output less confusing, but it is optional
-ksp_norm_type unpreconditioned
#sensible values? depends what you are doing
-ksp_max_it 20
-ksp_rtol 1.0e-4
#include this to see log the PETSc solver progress in pout.X etc
-ksp_monitor
    </pre>
  </li>
    <li> Edit your BISICLES input file. There are two ways to use PETSC:
<ul>
<li> As a bottom solver in the Chombo GMG solver. (if you don't know what that means, don't worry -- suffice it to say that in many cases, this option occupies the middle ground between the Chombo native GMG solvers and a full AMR AMG solver.). Assuming you are using the JFNKSolver for your velocity solve, add the following line to your inputs file:
<pre>
JFNKSolver.bottom_solver_type = 1
</pre>

<li> If that doesn't help, then you're ready for the full AMR PETSc solver. Assuming once again that you're using the JFNKSolver, then change 
<pre> 
  JFNKSolver.solverType = 0
  JFNKSolver.normType = 0
</pre>
to 
<pre> 
  JFNKSolver.solverType = 4
  JNKKSolver.normType = 2
</pre>

</ol>
