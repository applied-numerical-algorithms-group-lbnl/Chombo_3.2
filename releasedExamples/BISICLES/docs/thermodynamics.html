<h1>BISICLES Thermodynamics</h1>


<h2><a name='TW'>Temperature and water fraction</h2>

<p>
BISICLES has an optional thermodynamics component along the lines of Aschwanden et al, 2012
(doi: 10.3189/2012JoG11J088). It can be enabled by setting
</p>
<pre>
amr.isothermal = false
</pre>

<p>
  Following the Aschwanden et al 2012 model, the state variable, an energy density E
  (measured in J/kg), is composed from the temperature T and the water fraction w,
  such that E = CT + Lw, where C is the specific heat capacity, and L is
  the specific latent heat of fusion. E is a 3D field: the ice sheet
  is subdivided into n layers and  n values for E stored at the centre
  of each mesh cell. The uppermost layer is labelled layer 0,
  and the vertical distribution of layer interfaces is specified
  through the amr.sigma option. E.g, for 10 evenly spaced layers, set
</p>
<pre>
  amr.sigma = 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 
</pre>
<p>
  There are relatively few options to set for the thermodynamics component:
  the initial temperature, and the boundary conditions
  at the upper and lower surface. The initial temperature
  is set in the same manner as a constant-in-time temperature. In the
  Pine Island Glacier example, temperature is read from an hdf5
  file with temperatures specified at the centers of layers which
  subdivide the ice thickness evenly, with the options
</p>
<pre>
  temperature.type = LevelData
  inputLevelData.temperatureFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
  inputLevelData.temperatureName = temp000000
</pre>
<p>
  For a uniform initial temperature, set
</p>
<pre>
  temperature.type = constant
  temperature.value = 268
</pre>
<p>
  The file contains 10 variables, temp000000 to temp000009,
  specifying the temperature at sigma = 0.5,1.5, etc
</p>
<p>
  By default, the boundary condition at the upper surface
  prescribes zero heat flux. At the lower surface, the
  default geothermal flux is also zero, but the heat
  flux due to sliding friction is always imposed.
  The same means used to specify <a href='surfaceflux.html'>surface flux<a>
      for mass can be employed to set these fluxes, with
</p>
<pre>
  surfaceHeatBoundaryData.type = ...
  basalHeatBundaryData.type = ...
</pre>
<p>
  The fluxes are measured in J/a/m^2.
  It is also possible to set an upper surface temperature, rather
  than a heat flux, by setting
</p>
<pre>
  surfaceHeatBoundaryData.Dirichlett = true  # false by default
  surfaceHeatBoundaryData.Temperature = true # true by default
</pre>
<p>
  In that case the field specified by SurfaceHeatBoundaryData is
  taken to be as a temperature rather
  than a heat flux.
</p>

<h2><a name='till'>Drainage and till</h2>

<p>
  Englacial water does not increase in volume indefinitely: once the water fraction w grows
  beyond a certain value it is drained to a till layer. The current model is crude: it is
  similar (but cruder than) the drainage model of Aschwanden 2010. The relevant
  parameters, and their default values, are:
</p>
<pre>
  ColumnThermodynamics.water_fraction_drain = 0.01 
  ColumnThermodynamics.water_drain_factor = 0.02
  CoulmnThermodynamics.water_fraction_max = 0.05
</pre>
<p>
  The first parameter (water_fraction_drain) specifies a water fraction
  below which there is no drainage. The second (water_drain_factor) governs
  that rate of drainage - which is proportional to the water fraction,
  for water fractions up to to third parameter (water_fraction_max).
  water above this limit is immediately transferred to the till.
</p>
<p>
  Water in the till is itself transported elsewhere by the basal hydrology
  model. In the simplest, default case (see e.g van Pelt and Oerlemans, 2012, Bueler and van Pelt, 2015)
  it is simply lost (to a putative ground water system) at
  a rate proportional to the till water depth, and limited to a maximum value.
  
  These can be set with
</p>
<pre>
  ColumnThermodynamics.till_water_drain_factor = 0.001 #(default 0.001 1/a)
  ColumnThermodynamics.till_water_max = 4.0 # #(default 4.0 m)
</pre>
<p>
  It is possible to set a spatially variable till water drain factor using
  the <a href='surfaceflux.html'>surface flux classes</a>. The following
  example imposes vary rapid drainage in a disc around the origin,
  preventing till water from accumulating there.
</p>
<pre>
  #in the inputs.* file
  tillWaterDrainFactor.type = pythonFlux
  tillWaterDrainFactor.module = twc
  tillWaterDrainFactor.function =  till_water_drain_factor

  #in twc.py
  def till_water_drain_factor(x,y,*etc):
    R2 = (240e+3)**2
    factor = 0.005
    fast_factor = 1.0e+3
    r2 = x**2 + y**2
    if (r2 < R2):
        factor = fast_factor

    return factor
</pre>
<p>
  
</p>
<p>
  A more sophisticated basal hydrology model is in development.
</p>


<h2><a name='coupling'/>Coupling with the stress model</h2>

The thermodynamics model is coupled with the stress balance model
through  an (optional) temperature dependence of the
rate factor that appear in Glen's Law etc ( A(T) ), through
an (optional) similar factor in the basal traction that affects Weertman friction
rules, and through a relationship between till water depth and effective pressure
that affects Coulomb friction rules.
