<h1>BISICLES common issues</h1>


<h2><a name='nocompile'>The code does not compile</a> </h2>

<h2><a name='norun'>The code compiles but does not run</a> </h2>

<ol>

  <li>
    <strong>ImportError: No module named xyz</strong>. For some reason
  the python interpreter was unable to read xyz.py, e.g
  <pre>
ImportError: No module named rift
failed to import Python module rift
failed to import Python module  !!!
  </pre>
  In this case, either rift.py does not exists, or, it is in a directory
  outside $PYTHONPATH. By default $PYTHONPATH does not include
  the current working directory, so this is an easy mistake to make.
  Try e.g
  <pre>
    export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
  </pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name='crashes'>The code compiles and runs but crashes or fails
    in some spectacular way</a> </h2>

<p>
  Sometimes the code starts, but then terminates, leaving a
  more or less cryptic error in one other other log.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>maxFaceVelocity &gt; 0.5 * HUGE_VEL</strong>.
    A very common error. It implies
    that the velocity solver - which can fail for many reasons,
    has produced an enormous speed somewhere. Start off by looking
    at the <a href='velocity.html'>velocity calculation</a>, but
    be aware that the velocity solver might be struggling because
    of its inputs - especially the <a href='geometry.html'>geometry</a>
  and the <a href='stress.html#basal'>basal traction</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name='drivel'>The code compiles and runs to completions but the
    results are drivel</a> </h2>

<p>
  Arguably, all results are like this :). But there are some things to watch out
  for
