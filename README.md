## What is Chombo?

#### Chombo provides a set of tools for implementing finite difference and finite volume methods for the solution of partial differential equations on block-structured adaptively refined rectangular grids. Both elliptic and time-dependent modules are included. Chombo supports calculations in complex geometries with both embedded boundaries and mapped grids, and Chombo also supports particle methods. Most parallel platforms are supported, and cross-platform self-describing file formats are included.

#### The Chombo package is a product of the community of collaborators working with the Applied Numerical Algorithms Group part of the Computational Research Division at LBNL.

#### Chombo is a Swahili word meaning "tool" or "container".
